### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am Furkan from Istanbul, Turkey who is a enthusiastic developer [@trendyol](https://github.com/trendyol).

The KISS principle is everything for me. I'm thinking simplicity and design are created for our lives! I am trying to apply these principles to my life and business ğŸ˜˜

On the other hand, explore is an exciting thing. Travels, music, designs, technologies, development, and writing about something are my area of interests. I like meeting and making new friends ğŸ¤™
